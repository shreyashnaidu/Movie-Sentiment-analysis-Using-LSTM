SentimentLens: An NLP-Based Sentiment Analysis Model for Movie Reviews

Overview

SentimentLens is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning architectures and pre-trained embeddings, SentimentLens can accurately classify reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories, while also providing probabilistic sentiment scores for nuanced insights. This tool is ideal for movie studios, critics, and streaming platforms looking to better understand audience feedback.

Features

Advanced Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and handling of domain-specific jargon.

Feature Extraction: Utilizes embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and contextual embeddings from transformer models for richer semantic understanding.

Robust Model Selection: Combines traditional and deep learning techniques to ensure balanced accuracy and computational efficiency.

Probabilistic Sentiment Scoring: Generates nuanced sentiment scores for more insightful analysis.

Datasets

SentimentLens has been trained and evaluated on multiple movie review datasets, including:

IMDb Movie Review Dataset: Provides labeled positive and negative reviews.

Rotten Tomatoes Dataset: Offers sentence-level sentiment annotations.

Custom datasets were also created by scraping reviews from platforms like Metacritic and Amazon to introduce greater diversity and robustness to the model.

Architecture

Preprocessing

Text Cleaning: Removal of HTML tags, special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary whitespace.

Tokenization: Splitting text into meaningful units.

Stopword Removal: Excludes common, less-informative words (optional for sentiment context).

Feature Vectorization:

TF-IDF for traditional models.

Word embeddings for deep learning architectures.

Models

Na√Øve Bayes: Baseline probabilistic classifier using TF-IDF features.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): High-dimensional hyperplane separation with kernel functions.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Captures sequential dependencies and long-range context in reviews.

BERT: State-of-the-art transformer model for bidirectional contextual understanding.

Post-Processing

Class Mapping: Converts predictions into sentiment categories.

Error Analysis: Identifies misclassifications to improve model robustness.

Evaluation Metrics

To measure the performance of SentimentLens, we used the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.

Recall (Sensitivity): Ratio of true positive predictions to actual positive cases.

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of model performance.

Limitations

Handling Sarcasm and Irony: Challenges in detecting nuanced sentiments.

Computational Resources: High resource requirements for training and inference of deep learning models.

Language Specificity: Limited generalization across languages.

Future Work

Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Incorporating text, audio, and video signals.

Real-Time Sentiment Detection: Optimizing inference speed for live environments.

Low-Resource Language Support: Leveraging transfer learning for underrepresented languages.

Explainability: Improving model transparency for better interpretability.
